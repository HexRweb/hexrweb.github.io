			<h2 class="question">What is HexR?</h2>
			<p class="answer">HexR is an organization that was founded to provide <strong>free</strong>, modern websites to anyone because people should do what they do because they love it, not because it will pay the bills.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2 class="question">Where did you get the name HexR?</h2>
			<p class="answer">HexR is split into two parts - Hex and R. The reason we have Hex in our name is because it's the most complex simple shape to use in generating a display. It's simple enough to make the math easy, complex enough to make the programming easy. The R stands for what we expect and give in return - Respect, responsibility, reliability and responsiveness.</p>

			<h2 class="question">How much does a website cost?</h2>
			<p class="answer">For us to write it? Free. If you want more personalized options, like a domain or Google Apps, we cannot give you a discount (since we don't own it), so you will have to pay the costs they charge.</p>
