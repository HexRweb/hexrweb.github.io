The most important components / parts of any computer are the motherboard, RAM, the processor and data storage. Let's dive into further detail!</p><h3>The Motherboard</h3><p class="flow-text">The motherboard is the nervous system of a computer. It connects everything together through inputs, such as SATA (data-storage), PCI(E) (graphics cards and adapters), USB (plug 'n play devices), etc., allowing everything to communicate seamlessly.</p><h3>RAM</h3><p class="flow-text">RAM, also known as Random Access Memory, is the temporary data storage mechanism. It's usually used to store information that the computer uses a lot - such as system variables, the steps needed to accomplish something (such as open a new program) which is also called opcode, and program-specific storage (such as JavaScript variables). It's like short-term memory in animals; it's only kept as long as it's needed. RAM is volatile, meaning when it loses power, the data is lost. RAM is categorized; there is VRAM (Virtual RAM), DRAM (Dynamic RAM; constantly has to be updated but faster access), SRAM (Static RAM; slower but uses less power), etc. VRAM is usually stored on the OS drive, while DRAM is usually placed closer to the processor. SRAM isn't used often because of the latency (response time). DRAM has the lowest latency outside of the processor and VRAM is the most latent.</p><h3>The Processor</h3><p class="flow-text">The processor is responsible for processing! It is analogous to the brain in organisms. It works with the other components to perform calculations that range from basic (addition, subtraction) to complicated (media processing, rendering). If any calculations are necessary, you can thank the processor!</p><h3>Data Storage</h3><p class="flow-text">Data storage is equivalent to memories (to some extent) in humans. It's non-volatile (you can remove power and the data will not be lost) which is important for all those baby pictures! These are what we buy in large quantities - hard drives, flash drives, DVD's, floppy disks, etc. The two biggest types of long-term storage are mechanical (based on magnets) and flash (based on logic gates). As of now, flash storage is really expensive, but is much faster and has more write cycles (The amount of times you can write data to a specific part of the drive). Mechanical hard drives are bigger in capacity, although flash is catching up, it's cheaper, but it's a lot slower. Another disadvantage of mechanical drives is the fact that they're mechanical. Mechanical drives read data using an arm that physically moves along plates that store the data, while flash doesn't have a moving mechanism for reading. This is imperative for devices such as phones and tablets which are constantly moved and dropped. The use of mechanical drives would cause drive failure relatively quickly in these devices since the mechanism would be exposed to more wear. All data storage have a lifetime of around 6 years. It is highly recommended you use a RAID array for faster, redundant storage which is needed for important data. We'll discuss RAID in a future article.</p><p class="flow-text"> We’ve discussed the most important aspects of any computer - the motherboard, the processor, RAM and data storage.</p><p class="flow-text">Next month, we’ll talk about operating systems and networking!</p><p class="flow-text">See you then!</p><p class="flow-text">Until next months,<br/>~ The HexR Minions</p></div><div class="container"><a href="/the-book/jan-2016-introduction" class="left flow-text">Previous Post (Jan 2016 - Introduction)</a><a class="right hide white-text flow-text">Next Post (March 2016)</a></div><br /><br /><div id="disqus_thread" class="container"></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><?php
